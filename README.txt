Usage:
    Download the LiteInstaller.jar and execute it. This will create a directory "files" in the same directory as the jar.
    Move the files into the corresponding folders as they would be in .minecraft destination folder, ie:
        mods would go in a folder called "mods" beneath "files", so ".../files/mods/ProjectBench.zip
        coremods would go in a folder called "coremods" beneath "files"
        configs would go in a folder called "config" beneath "files"
    If it's the first time running the program, dismiss the error message saying there are no files.
    Once you've moved the files into the directory beneath "files" click on refresh. 
    Refreshing will update the GUI to show all the files, directory trees, and so on. This directly correlates to where it will be moved.
    Imagine that "files" is ".minecraft", as this is where the files will end up, in their directory.
    It will also copy directory trees and anything in subsequent folders without any further customization.
    
This program was designed to be distributed along side private/public mod packs or texture packs for easy installation.
Thus, distribution is allowed, but please contact me either on GitHub or on Minecraftforum.net as _bau5 and I will approve distribution as needed. 

Enjoy! And be sure to report any issues that may be incountered either here, or on the thread (tbd) on Minecraftforum.net.
